## Overview

VMSRI is a vim plugin which allows you to quickly open deviantART VMS Resource Identifiers.

## Features
 There is a number of keystrokes that mirror the `gf` family of keystrokes, that open a VMSRI
 instead of a filepath.
  - `gv` - opens a VMSRI in current buffer
  - `gV` - opens a VMSRI and jumps to a function call
  - `<C-W>v` - opens a VMSRI in a split window
  - `<C-W>V` - opens a VMSRI in a split window and jumps to a call
  - `<C-W>gv` - opens a VMSRI in a new tab
  - `<C-W>gV` - opens a VMSRI in a new tab and jumps to a call

## Installation
There are several plugin managers for vim, which will either allow you to
manually clone vim plugin repositories, or will do so for you. Probably the
two most popular ones currently are `pathogen
<https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen>`_ and `vundle
<https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim>`_. Please refer to their docs for
instructions on how to install plugins.
